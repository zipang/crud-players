TODOS MODELS
============

Each directory inside the models/ should contain at least the following files :

* `index.js` the main entry file exports a factory method `create` to instanciate new models instance. The validation of the data is guaranteed by the `create` method and on each setter.
* `schema.json` the JSON-schema that expose the structure and the validation rules of this model. It should also contain an examples section that contains an array of valid data that will be used for the tests.
* `validate.js` the validation method. It could be handwritten in simple cases or generated with `ajv-cli` (another json validator) with the following command line : `ajv -s schema.json -o validate.js`
* `index.spec.js`
* `validate.spec.js`
